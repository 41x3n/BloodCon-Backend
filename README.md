## Requirements

For development, you will need Node.js and MongoDB. To support email and sms, you will also need to get API key for SendGrid and Twilio. Also I have used enviroment variables so you need to make some modification.

### Node

- #### Node installation on Windows

  Just go on [official Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/) and download the installer.

If the installation was successful, you should be able to run the following command.

    $ node --version
    v10.16.0

    $ npm --version
    6.9.0

If you need to update `npm`, you can make it using `npm`! Cool right? After running the following command, just open again the command line and be happy.

    $ npm install npm -g
 
### MongoDB

- #### MongoDB installation on Windows

  Just go on [official MongoDB website](https://www.mongodb.com/download-center/enterprise) and download the installer.
